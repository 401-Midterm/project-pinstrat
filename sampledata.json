These missions are automatically enabled at the mission select screen once available.\n\nFirst, infiltrate the Disabled Collector Vessel to find information about this mysterious enemy and the Omega 4 Relay.\n\nThen, fight your way to the heart of a Derelict Reaper to find the IFF beacon to get you safely through the relay.\n\nFinally, integrate the IFF into the Normandy's systems and take the fight to the Collector Base deep in the galactic core.",
